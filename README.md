## 🧠 U-Net Architecture & Model Implementation

The core of this project is a custom implementation of the **U-Net architecture**, a fully convolutional neural network originally developed for biomedical image segmentation. What sets U-Net apart is its ability to perform **precise localization** while retaining **contextual information**, which makes it exceptionally effective for segmenting complex structures like skin lesions.

### 🔧 My Custom U-Net Implementation

I implemented the U-Net architecture from scratch using PyTorch, customizing each component to fit the 256x256 dermoscopic image inputs from the ISIC 2018 dataset:

#### Contracting Path (Encoder)
- Each block uses two 3x3 convolutions with ReLU activations followed by 2x2 max pooling  
- This path captures **semantic features** and **contextual depth**, progressively downsampling the image

#### Bottleneck
- Acts as the bridge between the encoder and decoder  
- Encodes **deep, abstract representations** of the input lesion

#### Expanding Path (Decoder)
- Transposed convolutions (upsampling) followed by concatenation with corresponding encoder features  
- Helps in **precise localization** by recovering spatial resolution lost during downsampling  
- Final layer maps the output to a single-channel binary segmentation mask

#### Skip Connections
- U-Net’s iconic skip connections are implemented to directly transfer low-level spatial features from the encoder to the decoder  
- This results in **sharper boundaries**, which are critical for medical segmentation tasks

## 🔍 How I Trained the Model

- **Loss Function**: `BCEWithLogitsLoss` — effective for binary classification of each pixel  
- **Optimizer**: `Adam` with a learning rate of `1e-4`  
- **Epochs**: 5 (can be scaled higher)  
- **Batch Sizes**: 8 for training, 4 for validation  
- **Device**: GPU-accelerated training using CUDA (when available)  
- **Preprocessing**: All images were resized to 256x256 and normalized; masks were binarized and reshaped to match model input dimensions
